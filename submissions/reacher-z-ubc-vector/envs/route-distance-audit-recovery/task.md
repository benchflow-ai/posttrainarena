## prompt

Recompute the declared route one directed leg at a time. Sum available edge distances to two decimals and enumerate every consecutive leg absent from the network table.

A prior attempt is supplied in prior_answer and is intentionally incomplete. Recompute the result from source records rather than trusting it, then list the top-level prior fields that required correction in the audit block.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
