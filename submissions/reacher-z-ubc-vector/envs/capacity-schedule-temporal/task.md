## prompt

Sequence candidate jobs by descending operational priority and stable identifier, admitting each job only when its demand fits remaining capacity. Report selections and unused capacity.

The fixture is an as-of analysis. Exclude records whose effective_at is later than the declared as_of timestamp before computing the domain result, and list the excluded future record IDs in the audit block.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
