## prompt

Build an admissibility-aware evidence coverage index. A claim is supported only when at least one nonempty source survives review; enumerate both supported and unsupported claim identifiers.

Treat every declared record as authoritative. Produce the primary result plus an audit block reporting the exact number of records used. This case establishes the ordinary workflow contract.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
