## prompt

Compare each service case deadline with the frozen analysis timestamp. Classify it as breached, due within twenty-four hours, or on-time without consulting wall-clock time.

Several rows share a logical key but disagree. Resolve each group by the greatest integer source_priority before doing the domain calculation. Report every resolved logical key in the audit block; retaining both conflicting rows is an error.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
