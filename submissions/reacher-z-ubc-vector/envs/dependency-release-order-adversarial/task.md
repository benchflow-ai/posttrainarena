## prompt

Construct a valid release sequence from dependency edges. Whenever multiple nodes are ready, choose the lexicographically smallest so the final topological order is uniquely reproducible.

Rows marked is_distractor=true are realistic decoys and must not influence the result. Exclude them, report their record IDs in the audit block, and use every remaining row exactly once.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
