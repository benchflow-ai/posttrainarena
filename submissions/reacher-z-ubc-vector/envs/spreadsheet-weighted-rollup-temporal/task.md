## prompt

Calculate portfolio totals as sum(quantity × unit value), serialize every group to two decimal places, and identify the winning group using the declared deterministic tie break.

The fixture is an as-of analysis. Exclude records whose effective_at is later than the declared as_of timestamp before computing the domain result, and list the excluded future record IDs in the audit block.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
