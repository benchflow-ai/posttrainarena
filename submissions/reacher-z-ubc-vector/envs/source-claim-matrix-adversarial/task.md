## prompt

Resolve competing research statements by source authority. For each claim choose the admissible statement with the smallest authority rank and separately report claims for which no admissible statement exists.

Rows marked is_distractor=true are realistic decoys and must not influence the result. Exclude them, report their record IDs in the audit block, and use every remaining row exactly once.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
