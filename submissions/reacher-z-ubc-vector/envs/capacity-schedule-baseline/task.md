## prompt

Sequence candidate jobs by descending operational priority and stable identifier, admitting each job only when its demand fits remaining capacity. Report selections and unused capacity.

Treat every declared record as authoritative. Produce the primary result plus an audit block reporting the exact number of records used. This case establishes the ordinary workflow contract.

Read `/root/instance.json` and write `/root/answer.json`. Preserve deterministic key ordering, do not modify the input, and include the required `audit` object alongside the domain result.
